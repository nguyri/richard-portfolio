    {key: nanoid(), html: <>
    <b>Color constancy.</b> Your brain will just make up colors depending on the surrounding color context, 
    so it can be very difficult to pick the right color every time. Blending modes give you a way to approach the color 
    you want without having to get it exactly right the first try. <br></br><br></br>
    <b>Big lighting decisions.</b> It's easiest to establish your lighting at the beginning and then render as needed. 
    Just like it's easiest to make a rough sketch, then refine it as you go along. If you need to add a big area of light or shadow, 
    you can add it all at once with a screen or multiply.<br></br><br></br>
    <b>Separate color from value.</b> Instead of having to work in one layer, a separate blending layer gives you some room 
    to play around with the forms before you commit to a lighting scheme. If you use multiply and screen separately, 
    you can also separate light from shadow. In some cases discussed later, you might use an overlay to do light and shadow in one layer. <br></br><br></br>
    <b>Small variations.</b> Sometimes, the difference between two shadows or two lit areas is tiny. It's actually impractical 
    to pick different color on the color wheel. In procreate color picking is confused with a disc: the triangle allows for a clear direction in each axis. Instead, adding a very light blending layer is easier.
